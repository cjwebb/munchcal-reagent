   [:p "MunchCal has only just been born, and is still in its infancy. Over the next weeks, and months, MunchCal will grow, develop, and learn new skills."]
   [:p "This page exists to fill you in about the plan for it in the upcoming weeks and months."]

   [:h2 "I'm Hungry"]
   [:p "MunchCal was conceived in order to answer the question 'What is for dinner?' once and for all."]
   [:p "MunchCal will be trained to recommend meals for you to eat, and then to assist in making them."]
   [:p "Eating is a complex exercise. It essentially boils down to consuming energy through food, but your body is far more complex than that. How many carbs are you eating? How much protein should you be taking in? Have you had enough Vitamin D? How about A, B, C, Zinc, Iron, Selenium? Eaten any Omega-3s today? You shouldn't have to think about all this stuff."]
   [:p "This is what MunchCal will know how to track, and use to recommend meals that fit into your life."]
  [:h2 "What's in the Fridge?"]
  [:p "One of the keys to knowing what is for dinner, is to know what food you have. As your Kitchen AI, MunchCal will keep track of the food in your fridge, and know how and when to order more."]
  [:p "If you allow it, we'd like to teach MunchCal to do the grocery shopping by itself too. We'll make sure it's a responsible adult before that though!"]

  [:h2 "Baby Steps"]
  [:p "In it's current state, MunchCal only fulfils about 1% of its potential. We won't mind if you don't like it yet. This is the first step in a journey towards an indepensible part of your life."]
  [:p "Seriously, if you need to search for a recipe, you should probably stick with Google for now."]
  [:p "We'll be pushing updates to MunchCal in the coming days, weeks, and months. The next thing we're working on is making the recipe ingredients more useful."]

  [:h2 "Contact Us"]
  [:p "If you have any thoughts, or opinions, talk to " [:a {:href "https://twitter.com/colinjwebb"} "Colin Webb"] " on Twitter. He'll be posting more MunchCal related things on there soon."]])
